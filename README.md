# Concurrent Signatures
In this seminar I presented the core ideas and a specific proof of the [concurrent signature scheme proposed by Chen et al.](https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2004/30270287/EC04Concurrent.pdf) in a presentation. Furthermore I explained and elaborated on the main points of my presentation in the paper.
